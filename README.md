# Lamp2Project_Group2

- Most Directories only have readme.txt, because Git does not allow push any empty directory. this is for Part1_A

- In db direcroty, there is a db.sql script. which is Part1_B. When you read instruction of LAMP2, it will be appreciated if you do any modification. the db.sql script is not perfect, especially about the name and type of fileds. Please help to check if they are correct and require the instruction of LAMP2.

- you can go to Mysql console and use source command to import the script into your Mysql server

- ```mysql
  $mysql>source "your db.sql location"
  ```
